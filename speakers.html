            <div class="offcanvas-body">Nana has worked as an actor for 49 years. She has performed on Broadway, in film 
                and on TV. She is best known for the seven years she played Major Kira on <i>Star Trek: Deep Space 9</i>. A 
                traumatic event while filming DS9 split her life in two: the part that automatically functioned as a 
                mother and actor, and the part that remained isolated and locked in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 
                It was more than 20 years before she found a doctor whose treatment included teaching her about the 
                science based information that MRIs have relatively recently revealed about how our brains and nervous 
                systems function. Not only did this heal her, but led to Post Traumatic Growth. It changed her 
                intrinsically, and her experience of being human. Nana is especially interested in opening a channel 
                to others who may not have had the time or the opportunity to learn what she believes everyone needs to 
                know. With just a little understanding of how we humans function, we can have greater control over ourselves 
                in demanding situations, and free our energies to focus them on the jobs we have at hand, not on managing 
                stress. She has written a book about the experiences of the women of <i>Star Trek</i> in the show's 5 decades, 
                and their impact on the culture. She discovered, while conducting interviews for the book with people at 
                NASA and ESA, just how many people were inspired to work in space programs by <i>Star Trek</i>. <i>OPEN A CHANNEL</i> 
                is being published in October. She is proud of her online community on Instagram, @visitornana, where 
                she is "Mama Nana" and shares what she has learned, through life experience and science, about being human. 
                She is also proud of son Buster, a medically retired Marine, and her son Django, a musician. Nana lives 
                in Los Angeles with her husband Matthew Rimmer and an assortment of animals.

            <div class="offcanvas-body">Dr. Christopher J. Schell is an urban ecologist, professor, Afrofuturist, father, and writer. 
                Schell's research sits at the intersection of animal behavior, physiology, urban biodiversity conservation, environmental 
                justice, and One Health to investigate how carnivores, namely coyotes, foxes, and raccoons, adapt to life in cities. <br><br>
                In addition, Schell's lab integrates critical discourses on how structural oppression (e.g., redlining, pollution burden, 
                and socioeconomic disparities) directly shape the very urban features associated with human-wildlife interactions, conflict, 
                and adaptation. This transdisciplinary work aims to disentangle how environmental injustices have structured our urban 
                ecosystems and how we can harness those lessons to build more just, biodiverse, and resilient cities. Schell is a National 
                Geographic Explorer, Grist Fixer, Cal Academy Fellow and Board Member, and Affiliate Faculty with the Museum of Vertebrate 
                Zoology, with his work featured in The Atlantic, The New York Times, Vox Explained, and various NPR radio events. <br><br> Since 2021, 
                Schell has served on the faculty in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) at the University 
                of California, Berkeley. A born-and-raised Los Angelean now firmly planted in the Bay Area, Schell weaves his lived experiences 
                as a Black man and Californian to coproduce justice- and equity-centered research programs with local communities that regenerate 
                urban nature, environmental health, and access for all peoples.

            <div class="offcanvas-body">Nathan Schwagler cofounded the innovation labs at one of the most iconic museums in the world.<br><br>
                A 2009 graduate of the University of South Florida's Muma College of Business, Schwagler has worked in the Dali Museum 
                in St. Petersburg for nearly four years, serving as the lead program designer and executive facilitator.<br><br>
                Getting there was a natural progression after he graduated from USF's Center for Entrepreneurship, which in November 
                was ranked No. 10 in the nation for graduate entrepreneurship programs and was named the best program in the Southeast 
                by Entrepreneur magazine and The Princeton Review.<br><br>
                The center has been on Entrepreneur magazine's Top 25 list for the past 10 years and is the only Florida school to make 
                the grade.<br><br>
                "I'm not surprised in the least," he said, "that the faculty and administrators of USF's Center for Entrepreneurship have 
                again been recognized as one of the top graduate program providers in the United States."<br><br>     
                His education at the center taught him how to identify opportunities and focus on solving underlying problems experienced 
                by key stakeholders, end users and paying customers.<br><br>
                At the Dali Museum, Schwagler develops innovation labs that offer corporate education courses on creativity and innovation, 
                applied creativity labs for clients interested in tackling real-world organizational challenges and custom-designed corporate 
                offsite retreats.<br><br>
                As a consultant prior to his current position, Schwagler supported more than 100 organizations and thousands of innovators 
                in the mapping, development and deployment of their innovation capabilities, with the goal of driving business outcomes.<br><br>
                "Not only did the center help me begin to see the world, and my life, through opportunity-colored lenses," he said, "but these 
                skills also became the foundation upon which I've built my career as a business professional."<br><br>
                Schwagler, 33, is a published author of peer-reviewed and press articles as well as a co-authored textbook titled, 
                "Organizational Creativity: A Practical Guide for Innovators and Entrepreneurs." He has delivered presentations that 
                range from "Art, War and B-School Innovation" to "Techniques for Utilizing Surrealist Artwork to Instigate Creative 
                Cognition." He has held workshops at dozens of academic conferences over the past eight years.<br><br>
                He holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from State University of New York College at Buffalo and dual master's degrees 
                in creative problem solving and applied entrepreneurship. "I use what I learned at USF every single day," he said. "Those 
                skills have been integral to helping teams and organizations identify interesting problems and then solve them with creativity, 
                imagination and entrepreneurial thinking."<br><br>
