                                    <div class="offcanvas-body">Haley began her journey while attending Penn State as a math major in the ROTC program. There 
                                        she wore a uniform while training with other officer candidates as well as wearing a cheerleading uniform cheering on 
                                        the Nittany Lions.<br><br>
                                        She then commissioned into the Air Force and was ordered to Atlanta, Ga., to recruit young men and women into ROTC. 
                                        She once again found herself in two uniforms — the Air Force’s and an Atlanta Falcons cheer uniform.<br><br>
                                        Upon her next move with the USAF — to Beale Air Force Base in California — she was assigned as a section commander 
                                        leading more than 300 personnel. And, once again, she donned two uniforms — the Air Force’s and the 49ers cheer uniform.<br><br>
                                        Haley says her Air Force peers and superiors were all supportive of her role on the NFL cheerleading teams. She was 
                                        featured in a Monday Night Football opening segment in November 2021 as an active-duty officer and a 49ers cheerleader — 
                                        shown in both uniforms.<br><br>
                                        Upon her Air Force career ending in June 2021, she immediately set out to create the bodysuit that would replace the 
                                        ubiquitous military t-shirt. She found a manufacturer in Los Angeles and began fulfilling the orders from her home. 
                                        She hosted pop-ups, attended military conferences and had countless meetings at various military installations showcasing TORCH wear.<br><br>
                                        “I decided it was time to take TORCH to the next level and applied for “Shark Tank,” Haley says.
                                        It was a three- to four-month process of face time interviews with producers — covering her life story and how she 
                                        ultimately became an entrepreneur.

                                            Schell’s research sits at the intersection of animal behavior, physiology, urban biodiversity conservation, environmental 
                                            justice, and One Health to investigate how carnivores – namely coyotes, foxes, and raccoons – adapt to life in cities. <br><br>
                                            In addition, Schell’s lab integrates critical discourses on how structural oppression (e.g., redlining, pollution burden, 
                                            and socioeconomic disparities) directly shape the very urban features associated with human-wildlife interactions, conflict, 
                                            and adaptation. This transdisciplinary work aims to disentangle how environmental injustices have structured our urban 
                                            ecosystems and how we can harness those lessons to build more just, biodiverse, and resilient cities. Schell is a National 
                                            Geographic Explorer, Grist Fixer, Cal Academy Fellow and Board Member, and Affiliate Faculty with the Museum of Vertebrate 
                                            Zoology, with his work featured in The Atlantic, The New York Times, Vox Explained, and various NPR radio events. <br><br> Since 2021, 
                                            Schell has served on the faculty in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) at the University 
                                            of California, Berkeley. A born-and-raised Los Angelean now firmly planted in the Bay Area, Schell weaves his lived experiences 
                                            as a Black man and Californian to coproduce justice- and equity-centered research programs with local communities that regenerate 
                                            urban nature, environmental health, and access for all peoples.

                                    <div class="offcanvas-body">Nathan Schwagler cofounded the innovation labs at one of the most iconic museums in the world.<br><br>
                                        A 2009 graduate of the University of South Florida's Muma College of Business, Schwagler has worked in the Dali Museum 
                                        in St. Petersburg for nearly four years, serving as the lead program designer and executive facilitator.<br><br>
                                        Getting there was a natural progression after he graduated from USF's Center for Entrepreneurship, which in November 
                                        was ranked No. 10 in the nation for graduate entrepreneurship programs and was named the best program in the Southeast 
                                        by Entrepreneur magazine and The Princeton Review.<br><br>
                                        The center has been on Entrepreneur magazine's Top 25 list for the past 10 years and is the only Florida school to make 
                                        the grade.<br><br>
                                        "I'm not surprised in the least," he said, "that the faculty and administrators of USF's Center for Entrepreneurship have 
                                        again been recognized as one of the top graduate program providers in the United States."<br><br>     
                                        His education at the center taught him how to identify opportunities and focus on solving underlying problems experienced 
                                        by key stakeholders, end users and paying customers.<br><br>
                                        At the Dali Museum, Schwagler develops innovation labs that offer corporate education courses on creativity and innovation, 
                                        applied creativity labs for clients interested in tackling real-world organizational challenges and custom-designed corporate 
                                        offsite retreats.<br><br>
                                        As a consultant prior to his current position, Schwagler supported more than 100 organizations and thousands of innovators 
                                        in the mapping, development and deployment of their innovation capabilities, with the goal of driving business outcomes.<br><br>
                                        "Not only did the center help me begin to see the world – and my life – through opportunity-colored lenses," he said, "but these 
                                        skills also became the foundation upon which I've built my career as a business professional."<br><br>
                                        Schwagler, 33, is a published author of peer-reviewed and press articles as well as a co-authored textbook titled, 
                                        "Organizational Creativity: A Practical Guide for Innovators and Entrepreneurs." He has delivered presentations that 
                                        range from "Art, War and B-School Innovation" to "Techniques for Utilizing Surrealist Artwork to Instigate Creative 
                                        Cognition." He has held workshops at dozens of academic conferences over the past eight years.<br><br>
                                        He holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from State University of New York College at Buffalo and dual master's degrees 
                                        in creative problem solving and applied entrepreneurship. "I use what I learned at USF every single day," he said. "Those 
                                        skills have been integral to helping teams and organizations identify interesting problems and then solve them with creativity, 
                                        imagination and entrepreneurial thinking."<br><br>
